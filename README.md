# Matt Herich - Impact Coding Test (Java)

Implement the following problems in Java (preferably Java8)

## Delimited List
Write code which has the ability to produce a comma delimited list of
numbers, grouping the numbers into a range when they are sequential. The input array
can contain negative numbers. The input is not sorted either.

Sample input : `[10,8,9,-2,4,0,-1,12]`

Sample output : `-2:0, 4, 8-10, 12`

## Good Strings
Mr. X is very fond of strings (or so he thinks!). But he doesn’t like strings
which have duplicate consecutive letters, and nobody knows why. He calls these strings
“Bad Strings,” and “Good Strings” are strings which don’t have duplicate consecutive
letters. In order to make Mr. X happy, given a string S, you’ll need to convert it into a
“Good String.”

NOTE: If you can think of different ways to solve this problem, please provide them and
indicate which one you prefer, and why.


## Find Duplicate Elements
You’re given an input array of n positive integers where those integers are
in random order. Each number in the array can occur many times. Find all the distinct
duplicate elements and put those elements into an array. The output should be ordered.

## Complete String
A string is said to be “complete” if it contains all the characters from A to Z.
Given a string, check if it’s “complete” or not.

### Evalutation
Make sure that your code is clean and easy to read. Use good object-oriented methodologies. If
you make any assumptions, be sure to express them clearly.
The items being evaluated are:

* Your ability to understand / interpret a requirement.
* Your coding ability.
* Optimization of your code.
* Your ability to compile a structured solution.

Good luck, and happy coding!
