# Matt Herich - Impact Coding Test Solution

I have commented on my assumptions for each problem as well as the alternative solutions I could have explored in javadoc comments at the top of each class.

I also decided to get some practice with the Java swing and awt frameworks for creating a gui.

### How to use the GUI

Start by running `java -jar ImpactCodingTest.jar` in the `root` of the project.

* **Delimited List** accepts a comma separated list of integers with NO spaces.
* **Good Strings** accepts any old string.
* **Find Duplicate Elements** accepts a comma separated list of integers with NO spaces.
* **Complete String** accepts any old string.
